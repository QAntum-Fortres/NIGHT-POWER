**When someone asks about Selenium alternatives:**
```
I've been using QAntum lately and it's been solid. The main wins for me:
- Setup is literally `npx qantum init` (no WebDriver headaches)
- Tests are way more stable than my Selenium suite
- Has built-in security testing which saved us once

Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try it.
```

**When someone complains about flaky tests:**
```
Flaky tests were killing my team too. We ended up trying QAntum 
which has this AI self-healing feature - basically if a selector 
breaks, it finds an alternative automatically.

Sounds like magic but it actually works. Our flaky test rate went 
from ~20% to under 2%.

Hi HN,

I'm Dimitar, and I've been building QAntum for the past year.

After years of fighting with Selenium (flaky tests, complex setup, 
no security testing), I decided to build something better.

QAntum is a TypeScript-first test automation framework with:

- AI self-healing: Tests adapt when UI changes
- Ghost Mode: Undetectable browser automation
- Security scanning: XSS, SQL injection, CSRF detection built-in
- Zero config: `npx qantum init` and you're ready

Demo: [link]
GitHub: [link]
Docs: [link]

Would love feedback from the HN community. What features would 
make you switch from your current testing tool?
```

### HN Best Practices
- Post at 9-10 AM EST (Tue-Thu)
- Reply to every comment
- Be humble, accept criticism
- Don't ask for upvotes
- Prepare for tough questions

```

**First Comment (Maker):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Dimitar, the creator of QAntum.

I built this after years of maintaining thousands of Selenium tests 
that broke constantly. Every UI change meant hours of selector updates.

QAntum's AI learns your app and automatically fixes broken selectors.
Plus, it includes security testing and Ghost Mode for when you need 
undetectable automation.

Would love your feedback! What testing pain points should we solve next?
