Quick security observation on payhawk.com - free fix included
```

### BODY:
```
Hi Payhawk Security Team,

I'm Dimitar Prodromov, founder of QAntum - an automated QA and security testing platform based in Bulgaria.

During a routine public scan (same methodology as SecurityHeaders.com), I noticed a small optimization opportunity on payhawk.com that takes 2 minutes to fix:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 PUBLIC SCAN SUMMARY (payhawk.com)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SSL: Valid (Google Trust Services, expires in 59 days)
✅ HSTS: Enabled
⚠️  HSTS Preload: Not submitted to hstspreload.org
⚠️  Missing: X-XSS-Protection header
⚠️  Missing: Referrer-Policy header

Overall: 75/100 (Good, but not perfect)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔧 FREE FIX (Nginx)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;

# After testing, submit to: https://hstspreload.org

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

That's it. No sales pitch, no follow-up pressure.

I run these scans to practice my craft and occasionally find companies that might benefit. As a fellow Bulgarian tech company, I thought you'd appreciate the heads-up.

If you ever need a full security audit or automated QA testing, I'm happy to chat - but zero obligation.

Best,
Dimitar Prodromov

Hi! 👋

Fellow Bulgarian founder here. I noticed payhawk.com during a routine security scan.

Your HSTS config is missing the preload directive + 2 minor headers.

Happy to share the 3-line fix if useful. No pitch, just keeping the ecosystem strong.
